# Load Balancing Problem

### Description

This library is a tool created to compare different algorithms solving load balancing problem.


### Instructions

All required packages are listed in requirements.txt.
You can check out example.ipynb through Jupyter Notebook or lvp/main.py 

To create new algorithm inherit lvp.algorithms.abstract_lb.LbAlgorithm and implement all needed methods. 
Add name of your algorithm to lvp/main.py as a constant and as a part of METHODS_TO_CLASSES dictionary.
